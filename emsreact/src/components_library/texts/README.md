# Texts are React components that are defined as follows:

Texts define text style.

They can define font, text color, text-overflow,
overflow, white-space, text-indent, text-align,
text-decoration, line-height

No positioning allowed here.

No margins, no padding, no display attribute. These attributes go to panes.

See panes/README.md
