If you are slow, you lose money and people remember that your website didn’t work and don’t come back.<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>You don’t have time to understand cryptic error messages or to guess what to do to fix them<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p>You don’t have time to understand what a function does or what a variable contains. The original developer may be on holiday or she may not be able to remember what that variable was about if its name doesn’t help.<\/p>\n\n<p>A good structure helps too. If the software is easy to browse, errors are easier to find.<\/p>\n\n<p>A production manual is a good idea.<\/p>\n\n<p>I was managing a team whose goal was to design the production activities to be performed on a group of servers delivering virtual ISP services.<\/p>\n\n<p>I knew that a production manual was what we needed to ensure a smooth operation.<\/p>\n\n<p>Every event was documented in the manual along with it’s troubleshooting measures and the log of every case of occurrence.<\/p>\n\n<p>In many cases I have written such a high quality software that production was going on event-less. This is the case of my PLC software and the software I have written for Intel Corporation.<\/p>",
