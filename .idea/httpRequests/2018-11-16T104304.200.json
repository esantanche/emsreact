This is due to Drupal being written in PHP. The Php Application Server runs every PHP file that needs to be executed.<\/p>\n\n<h2>The environment<\/h2>\n\n<p>Web server, Php Application Server and React Application Server run on a Debian 8 server. There is a MySQL server as well because Drupal needs it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The web server root folder is \/srv\/sites\/rankit.emanuelesantanche.com\/.<\/p>\n\n<p>The subfolder rankitapp contains everything the React Application Server needs to run.<\/p>\n\n<p>The subfolder backend will contain the installation of Drupal 8 I’m going to perform.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Configure Nginx to run the Drupal backend<\/h2>\n\n<p>As I said above, the web server, in my case Nginx, will forward requests meant for Drupal to the Php Application server, which will run the php files containing Drupal’s logic.<\/p>\n\n<p>I have to configure Nginx for it to do this.<\/p>\n\n<p>The main part of the Nginx configuration I need is this one:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>location \/backend {<\/code><br \/><code>    if (!-e $request_filename) {<\/code><br \/><code>        # We need \/backend here because the root is \/srv\/sites\/rankit.emanuelesantanche.com\/<\/code><br \/><code>        # The rewrite pattern strips "
