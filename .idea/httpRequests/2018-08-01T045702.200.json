    ">“Soul Trader – Putting the Heart into Your Business”<\/a>. It’s a precious book from which you can learn a lot, especially about how to make your business human.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Soul Trader is packed with advice<\/h2>\n\n<p>The book starts with “Clarity”. Rasheed tells us about how to make clarity in our business. He helps us answer many questions and shows us how the answers will bring clarity and clear doubts. This is a very good thing to do and it’s good to do it with the help of someone who has a different point of view.<\/p>\n\n<p>Soul Trader is a goldmine of advice and practical ideas about many other subjects, like cooperation, talking with clients and creativity.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Clarity in my business<\/h2>\n\n<p>I made some clarity in my business as software developer.<\/p>\n\n<p>I realised that I love solving problems. I also love taking time to understand what my clients want or need to build.<\/p>\n\n<p>I enjoy learning as well. New technologies sprout every day and they are examples of human ingenuity.<\/p>\n\n<p>I enjoy seeing how humans produce new ideas all the time.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Compassion in business?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Is there any space for compassion in business? Isn’t it a dog-eat-dog situation?<\/p>\n\n<p>This is what I used to think. Now I think that without compassion a business becomes a chore that makes nobody happy.<\/p>\n\n<p>First thing first we need to use our compassion to take care of ourselves.<\/p>\n\n<p>Our well-being needs to be well above any goal we want to achieve because otherwise we are likely not to enjoy it.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Listening is good<\/h2>\n\n<p>Listening makes the person you are talking to feel heard.<\/p>\n\n<p>Listening is related to compassion and starts from ourselves. We need to listen to ourselves before we can listen to others.<\/p>\n\n<p>Listening is very important when working with clients especially when what we want to build is complex or new.<\/p>\n\n<p>This doesn’t mean that you renounce to speak your opinion if it’s different from your client’s one.<\/p>\n\n<p>It would be bad service.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Richard is my best friend<\/h2>\n\n<p>Richard is a client of mine. But he is more of a friend than of a client.<\/p>\n\n<p>I ask him for advice about my personal life too.<\/p>\n\n<p>I built a fantastic application for him.<\/p>\n\n<p>It was challenging because there were patented technologies involved with the complexity they imply.<\/p>\n\n<p>I was listening to him and taking time to understand.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n<p>Rasheed is an inspiring business and life coach, if you feel the need for a human business.<\/p>\n\n<p>His “Soul Trader” contains a lot of useful and inspiring advice.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you think that compassion and humanity are needed to find a balance between business and life, you may want to join the club of the Soul Traders.<\/p>",

OS\/2 servers are employed as well.<\/p>\n\n<p>These servers build their portion of database gathering information coming from third-level computers connected to them.<\/p>\n\n<p>This whole system has, as its goal, to collect information about the performance of applications running on the third-level computers. This information is subsequently elaborated for statistical purposes.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Structure of the distributed database and nature of the protocols used to manage and transmit data<\/h2>\n\n<p>The distributed database has a structure defined according to the criteria used by the SNMP protocol.<\/p>\n\n<p>The latter defines the information produced and managed using a data definition standard named MIB (Management Information Base).<\/p>\n\n<p>The MIB, with its definitions, is found in the top level UNIX servers while the second level servers physically hold the actual information.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second level servers deliver the information to the top level servers according to the standard defined by the MIB.<\/p>\n\n<p>Data transmission uses the protocols SNMP, TCP and UDP.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Project organization<\/h2>\n\n<p>The whole ‘Performance Monitoring’ project was quite big. It lasted for many years and many people worked on it.<\/p>\n\n<p>The IBM Rome Software Laboratory was in charge of it.<\/p>\n\n<h2>Activities performed by Emanuele Santanchè<\/h2>\n\n<p>Emanuele Santanchè’s assignment was to convert the OS\/2 version of the software managing the second level servers into a Windows NT version.<\/p>\n\n<p>Working on this assignment, a change in the software architecture had been in order because the OS\/2 architecture was based on an independent process while the Windows NT architecture uses DLLs whose functions were called by the SNMP Agent process.<\/p>\n\n<p>A substantial part of the SNMP protocol as implemented by OS\/2 has been rewritten because the Windows NT’s implementation of SNMP offers far fewer functionalities than the OS\/2 counterpart.<\/p>\n\n<p>Doing the conversion from OS\/2 to Windows, the software was improved by increasing its ability to reply to the messages coming from the first and third level computers.<\/p>\n\n<p>This was achieved by introducing multi-thread architecture and inter-thread synchronization.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Windows NT SNMP agent presented some bugs and, since its code couldn’t be changed, workarounds had been implemented to solve the malfunctioning.<\/p>\n\n<p>Rome, 15\/3\/1999<\/p>\n\n<p>Signed by Massimo Zannori of IBM Semea S.p.A.<\/p>\n\n<p>(the original is available)<\/p>","langcode":"English","field_ems_topic":"Testimonials","sticky":"On","field_image":"\/sites\/default\/files\/2018-07\/Intel_logo600x600_0.png"},{"nid":"48","title":"Making Earth-satellite communications better","body":"<p>This was a project by the CNR, the Italian <a href="http:\/\/www.cnr.it\/sitocnr\/Englishversion\/Englishversion.html">National Research Council<\/a>.
