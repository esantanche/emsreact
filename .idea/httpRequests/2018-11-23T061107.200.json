Furthermore, our software will be more durable and valuable<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">While a photo is static, software is a living thing. It will benefit from its beauty because it will be easier to change and to adapt to the unavoidable changing of requirements.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Now let’s see how we can use rules borrowed from photography to make our code look better.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">The rule of thirds<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">In photography this rule is about not putting the most important subject at the centre of the photo. We don’t want our photo to look like a mugshot. We want to make the photo lighter by giving space to other subjects of minor importance.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Writing software we can do the same thing. Actually we do it all the time. We don’t put all the important code in a single file. <strong>We balance the code among many files<\/strong>. Doing this our composition is lighter. It isn’t burdened by the presence of a single heavy file full of critical code.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Leading Lines<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The rule of thirds wasn’t much of a surprise for me. When developing software we use the same rule all the time. The rule of leading lines, instead, has been a surprise because it has given me a new idea to use to make my code better.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">When we look at a photo, our eyes are naturally captured by lines. Placing lines differently in a photo, we can change how we view the photo. A photo will draw our look differently if the lines run from left to right or from top to bottom.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">How do I see lines in PHP code? I see lines of execution. Let me explain.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">When we create a program, we aim to build a functionality. We imagine the software’s user typing some information and getting the wanted result, so we hope.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">We imagine the user typing some typical information.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">But a user might type atypical information as well. They might type a name where a number is required, and so on.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Our execution line is disturbed by many exceptions and special cases<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">This way our look can’t benefit from following the leading line of execution. There are branches and bushes all around.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>It could be a good idea to highlight the main execution line using custom colours for syntax highlighting<\/strong>. Many <a href="http:\/\/emanuelesantanche.com\/php-ide-comprehensive-facilities-for-php-programmers\/">PHP IDEs<\/a> allow customization of syntax highlighting.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">We could use lighter colours for the parts of code that disturb the main execution line.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Symmetry and Patterns<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Photos portraying symmetrical objects or patterns can make for a very eye-catching composition.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>In software we can introduce symmetry in our name conventions and in the organization of files<\/strong>. Patterns of code (we can call them templates as well) can be used to reduce building time and the probability of mistakes.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Using symmetry and patterns, code can be read and understood in less time.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Viewpoint<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">This is easy. Change the viewpoint and you change a photo dramatically.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>We humans have this wonderful feature that we each see the world in his or her own way<\/strong>. When we want to standardise people, we destroy this diversity. It’s a bit like destroying a tropical forest or making a rare species become extinct.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">On the other hand, it’s smarter to take advantage of this diversity. It can bring a richness of solutions and ideas.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Background<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Sometimes you want to take a shot of a subject and you don’t want the background to detract from it. Your photo would lack impact if the background is too busy.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">When writing a PHP script, it may happen that the most important step is blended among many other less important ones.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">To prevent this busy background of steps from detracting from the main one, <strong>it’s a good idea to merge the steps coming before the main one in a single “pre” function. The steps coming after can go into a “post” function<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">For instance, if you have to run a query against a database, the most important step is the query itself. So you can group all the preparatory steps in a function and, similarly, all the closing steps in a another function.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">This will highlight the main step, which is the query.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Depth<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Photos are two-dimensional. How do you convey a sense of depth using a two-dimensional medium?<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">You include in your photo objects which are near you, at a medium distance and far away.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>You use this idea when writing software by creating functions which break down a task in more and more detailed levels<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">You write a function that calls three other functions which each call another three functions, and so on until you get to the lowest level of detail.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It may seem that to write a single function at greater length and in more detail may be better. Instead, it adds beauty, and reading easiness, to your code if you add depth to it.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Framing<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Objects such as trees, archways and holes create frames around a subject, thus creating a focused image.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Developing PHP code, we have PHP frameworks. They create a frame around our code<\/strong>. They take care of basic functionalities and design choices so that we can focus on the high level functionalities we need to create.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Cropping<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">You crop a photo if you want to draw attention to a detail. You crop tight around it to prevent it from drowning in a sea of other subjects.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>In your PHP code there might be details that you want to examine more closely now and then. You can tag them<\/strong>. I use the tag FIXME a lot. I have even defined a keyboard shortcut to insert it where I need it.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">I use it to remind myself which parts of my code need more work.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">You can define a tag and use it to mark all the code that needs to be changed to introduce or modify a functionality. Later, you make the changes and delete the tags.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Using a PHP IDE, you can define a custom syntax highlighting which you switch on when you want to examine code lines which have been given a tag.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Let’s call this “code cropping”.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Experimentation<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Rules are made to be broken in PHP code writing as well as in photography.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">A rule has to make sense for it to add beauty and value to your code. Don’t apply them blindly otherwise you may end up doing more harm than good.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">This experiment of borrowing creative practices from photography seems to have produced interesting results.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>They will help to write more beautiful and valuable software<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">I don’t recommend using these techniques when writing a prototype. When your software still needs to find a final form, it’s better to write prototypes to showcase basic functionalities.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">At this stage of software creation we don’t need to care about the beauty in our code. We want to create it fast and use it to stimulate the development of more complete and stable requirements.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">So, at this stage, our software doesn’t need to be beautiful because that would be a waste. We will destroy this software once it has accomplished its function.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">When we have stable requirements, we can begin to create new software in a final form and then we need beautiful code because this software has to last and to be easily maintained.<\/p>","langcode":"English","field_ems_topic":"Talking about my experiences","sticky":"Off","field_image":"\/sites\/default\/files\/2018-08\/photographer.jpg"},{"nid":"89","title":"Php editor, an indispensable tool","body":"<p dir="ltr">A php editor is a must-have tool for a php developer. Even if you are a beginner you need something more than a standard text editor when you write your php scripts.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">A basic php editor offers many functionalities that help greatly and eliminate many distractions that make your creative efforts more difficult.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Let’s look at these basic functionalities.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Syntax highlighting<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Every language keyword is highlighted in a different colour. You will see that the keywords: if, switch, else, return, case, are rendered in a colour different from the ones used for other parts of your script.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">You will know at first glance which keywords are standard parts of the php language and which ones are variables, strings or constants.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Auto-completion<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Just type the first letters of a keyword and you will be presented with a list of the keywords beginning with those letters. After you choose a keyword from this list, the editor will show information about that keyword. If the keyword you chose is the name of a function, the editor will show a description of the function and its parameters.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Snippets<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Just type “if” followed by the tab key, or other standard key, and you get the brackets automatically. Or just type “table” and you get the full structure of an html table.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Wizards<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Press a button and you will be guided through many dialogs that help you choose the parameters needed to write html, php or css constructs.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Symbol browser<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">You want to modify a function but you can’t remember which file it is in. The symbol browser lists all your functions and takes you to where they are defined with just a click.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Search and replace in multiple files<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">What if you have to change a name or a symbol used in many files? It happens more often than you might imagine.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Just tell the editor what you want to change and it will make the change in all the open files or even in an entire directory.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Let’s look at a few php editors.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Free php editors, multi-platform<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Let’s begin with free php editors, free as in free beer.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The following are also multi-platform. You can use them on Linux, Windows and Mac.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Geany\u003C\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/www.geany.org\/">Geany<\/a> is a light editor, it’s fast and it does everything we need.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It highlights syntax. It’s possible to customise the colours used to highlight.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It auto-completes syntax keywords and shows the parameters to be given to a function. It doesn’t show information about what a function is for.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Snippets are supported and customisable. There are no wizards to insert html or css. There is a symbol browser instead, and you get the powerful search-and-replace function extended to all open files.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">I’m writing about Geany here, on the php editor’s page because it’s so light that you can use it as your everyday text editor. At the same time <strong>it has functionalities that qualify it as a <a href="http:\/\/emanuelesantanche.com\/php-ide-comprehensive-facilities-for-php-programmers\/">PHP IDE<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">With Geany you can check the syntax of your php scripts and you can debug them as well.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Bluefish<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/bluefish.openoffice.nl\/index.html">Bluefish<\/a> has the <strong>wizards<\/strong> that Geany lacks. I recommend Bluefish if you do a lot of html or css writing. Geany is better if you do more pure php scripting.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Bluefish features syntax highlighting and <strong>you can customise the colours used to highlight more easily<\/strong> than in Geany.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Bluefish’s autocompletion is fully functional<\/strong>. It explains the function that you choose and its parameters. If you move your mouse over the name of a function, you get the description of it.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">There is snippet support via a plugin and there are many wizards that help with writing html, css and php code.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>There is no symbol browser<\/strong>. Unlike Geany, <strong>Bluefish is a pure editor and hasn’t any IDE functionalities<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">jEdit<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/www.jedit.org\/">jEdit<\/a> is Java based. If you like the look and feel of Java applications, jEdit is for you.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Autocompletion<\/strong> in jEdit has to be activated pressing CTRL+b, which is <strong>not so convenient<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Syntax is highlighted and colours are highly customisable.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>jEdit indents your code if it gets messed up<\/strong>. You have to configure this function a bit to make it work.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">There are loads of <strong>plugins<\/strong> to implement a lot of functionalities. You can use snippets and even download them from a snippet repository.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">What about a symbol browser? You have to use a plugin named CtagsInterface which is a bit buggy.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">On the other hand, <strong>the search and replace function is great<\/strong>. It allows you to search and replace in all the open files and even in a directory.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">There are no wizards.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Komodo Edit<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/www.activestate.com\/komodo-edit">Komodo Edit<\/a> is a younger brother of <a href="http:\/\/www.activestate.com\/komodo-ide">Komodo IDE<\/a>. While the latter is a full PHP IDE, the former is a reduced version featuring editing functions only.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Komodo Edit is multi-platform but not Java based. It’s based instead on the same code used by Firefox.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It has customisable colour schemes and <strong>very good auto completion<\/strong> function. Syntax highlighting is easy to customise.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">You can jump to the definition of a function when you find it called in your script. There isn’t a symbol browser.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It’s possible to search and replace a string in the current file, in all open files and in a directory.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Komodo offers <strong>syntax check<\/strong> performed in real-time.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">There are a lot of useful snippets. <strong>Komodo is not as light as Geany<\/strong>. Anyway, if you like it, you will find yourself at home if you choose Komodo IDE as your PHP IDE.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Free php editors, Linux only<\/h2>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Gphpedit<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/www.gphpedit.org\/">Gphpedit<\/a> is even lighter than Geany, but it lacks many useful aspects.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">You will find that Gphpedit and Geany are similar because the code they are based on is the same.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Gphpedit’s search functionalities are very basic while auto-completion is good. It doesn’t add parentheses and braces if you begin an if statement.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">If you have php installed, Gphpedit will check the syntax of your code.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The symbol browser is the same as Geany. Snippets are not provided.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Gphpedit could be a bit richer<\/strong> and focused on php support. It’s light, but Geany is light too and richer.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Free php editors, Windows only<\/h2>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Notepad++<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/www.notepad-plus-plus.org\/">Notepad++<\/a> lives in Windows only but it is based on the same Scintilla component used by Geany.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It offers customisable syntax highlighting. <strong>The customisation options will make the most exigent of developers happy<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Notepad++ offers auto completion function with word completion, function completion and  function parameters hint.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The interface is very customisable. When you have many open files, it may be not enough to have them open in different tabs, you may want to arrange the tabs according to your preferences.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">You can search and replace in open files and even in directories.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">The symbol browser is called Function List. Snippets are managed through plugins.<\/p>\n\n<p dir=\u0022ltr"><strong>Notepad++ is complete<\/strong>, only wizards are missing, but there are many other useful functionalities.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Dev-PHP Editor<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/devphp.sourceforge.net\/">Dev-PHP<\/a> comes in two versions, editor and IDE.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Here I’m going to review the editor version of Dev-PHP. It features configurable syntax highlighting.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Its auto completion function offers completion of function name and parameters hints. Wizards produce the code needed for loops or other constructs. Just fill in the variable parts. Code snippets are customisable.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">There is a symbol browser that helps to find your functions quickly.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It’s possible to search in all the open files and in directories.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Dev-PHP is more than an editor, it has <strong>IDE functionalities<\/strong> and it’s quite complete.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Commercial php editors, Windows only<\/h2>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">DzSoft PHP Editor<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/www.dzsoft.com\/php-editor.html">DzSoft PHP Editor<\/a> is actually a full IDE. You can run and syntax-check your code.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">As editor, it features a <strong>very good symbol browser<\/strong> similar to the one offered by Geany. It’s also possible to jump to a function’s definition from a line where it is called.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Syntax highlighting is present and customisable.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Auto-completion of function names and parameters hints are provided. However <strong>to complete a function’s name you have to press ctrl+enter and choose the function from a list<\/strong>. You can type quickly the first 3-4 letters of the function’s name and the editor will find the function. You don’t get a description of the function or its parameters.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">There is the interesting possibility of choosing among <strong>many shortcut schemes<\/strong>. This is useful if you are accustomed to the shortcuts used in another editor.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">You can quickly insert snippets of code: here they are called code templates.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It’s possible to search all files in a directory, but there is no replace. Search and replace are fully supported only for the current file.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Personally, I prefer to stick to <strong>multi platform php editors<\/strong> because you never know if you will have to work on a Windows machine. Naturally I use Linux and LAMP platforms, but it may happen that I need to work on Windows machines and I want to use the same editor I use on Linux.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">I don’t like the look and feel of Java applications and I prefer not to pay if there isn’t a real need.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">So, I would have to choose between Geany, Bluefish and Komodo Edit. The latter isn’t as light as Geany.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">I would use Bluefish for html\/css work and Geany for PHP. Geany is also IDE and it may offer enough functions to obviate the need to learn another IDE.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">If you work a lot on Windows computers, you can consider the Windows-only PHP editors I have reviewed above.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">I would choose Notepad++ if I want a pure php editor.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">If you want a PHP IDE running under Windows only, use Dev-PHP Editor.

Some of them offer wizards that help with writing common code constructs.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">PHP IDEs take these functionalities to the next level and add more interesting ones.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">First, I will describe these functionalities. Later, I’ll see how these functionalities are implemented in some PHP IDEs.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Syntax checker<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">A good PHP IDE has to check your code’s syntax by just pressing a button or, better, in real time. It’s better if this happens automatically, without needing to configure it.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Debugger<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">A debugger executes your code showing the result of its execution alongside the code itself. Obviously you can slow down the execution and stop it to take time to inspect variables and execution flow. The best PHP IDEs have an integrated debugger needing little set-up.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Versioning System<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Generally, a PHP file is edited by one developer only. Sometimes two or more developers need to edit the same file. A versioning system makes this possible, avoiding conflicts or incongruent versions of the file. Such a system also keeps trace of every change made to a file along with its reason. This helps to solve problems caused by changes. <strong>A good PHP IDE supports many versioning systems without needing to install plugins or additional software<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Refactoring<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">A developer has to make naming choices continuously. She has to give a name to variables, functions, files, classes, and so on. It may happen that some choices are revealed to be poor, conflicting or unclear.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">To remedy these problems is not simply an aesthetic pastime. A variable whose name has nothing to do with its content, can cause misunderstandings, mistakes and loss of time.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">PHP IDEs offer functionalities, which go under the name of refactoring, that globally change names to more meaningful ones. Attention has to be paid not to alter a code’s behaviour.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Refactoring is not only about changing names. More advanced PHP IDEs have more sophisticated refactoring functionalities meant to <strong>improve code quality without altering its working<\/strong>.\u003C\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">PHPdoc<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">If you write comments about functions following the PHPdoc standard, a tool named phpDocumentor will collect all the comments you have written and make an html documentation which is easy to navigate.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>When you change a function, just change the comments about it and the documentation will be changed accordingly and automatically<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Every PHP project should have at least this sort of documentation, and a PHP IDE should support this.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">PHPUnit<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">This is less important. It’s needed if you do test-driven development. This means that first you define a test which a piece of code has to pass to be declared functional, and then you write that code. PHPUnit is software which you have to install and which your PHP IDEs has to seamlessly interface.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Integration with frameworks<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">If a PHP IDE somehow integrates with one or more PHP frameworks, it’s a good plus.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Now I’m going to review some PHP IDEs. They all will be <strong>multiplatform<\/strong>. <strong>You don’t want to learn another PHP IDE if this means that you have to change platform<\/strong>. PHP IDEs need quite a lot of time to learn.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Geany<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">I’ve reviewed <a href="http:\/\/www.geany.org\/">Geany<\/a> as a PHP Editor. It has a few IDE functionalities as well.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">If you install the php interpreter on your computer, Geany will check the syntax of your code. Not in real time.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Using a plugin, Geany will interface your versioning system. You can interface Geany to <a href="http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Apache_Subversion">Subversion<\/a> (also named SVN).<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately Geany doesn’t work with xdebug or other php debugger. To debug your code you have to use echo, var_dump or similar commands. However, this way to debug php code is perfectly fine for small and medium projects.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">There is no integration with frameworks and forget about PHPUnit.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Geany is very light and good for small projects<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Netbeans<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https:\/\/netbeans.org\/">Netbeans<\/a> is a java application.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">When I started it, I cringed when I saw the fonts it used.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Happily, I found that I could fix it.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Executing this command:<\/p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p dir="ltr">export _JAVA_OPTIONS=”-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel”<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Before running Netbeans, I instructed Java to use system fonts instead of its own. I also set the default look-and-feel to GTK, which looks much better than the standard one.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Doing this, Netbeans’ look-and-feel is acceptable. You can enjoy the functionalities and forget about the look-and-feel.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">\u003Cstrong>Netbeans checks your syntax in real time<\/strong> and without needing to configure anything. It gives you abundant hints about mistakes and keywords.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Netbeans interfaces with the well-known, and widely-used, debugger Xdebug. You have just to do some configuration.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Support for versioning systems is integrated<\/strong>. Subversion, CVS and Mercurial are the versioning systems used.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Refactoring is a menu item<\/strong>. Ready to use straight out of the box.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">What about PHPdoc? Just type “\/**” and hit Enter precisely before a function’s definition. Netbeans will create a PHPdoc compliant comment including the description of the function’s parameters. This is great.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">PHPUnit is supported.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Netbeans will help you write code for these PHP frameworks: Zend, CakePHP, Yii, Symfony2, FuelPHP. Just install the specific plugin.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Eclipse helios for php developers<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/www.eclipse.org\/downloads\/packages\/eclipse-php-developers\/heliosr">Eclipse<\/a> is the base for many other PHP IDEs. Here I’ll review the version of Eclipse named Helios and customised for PHP developers.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Eclipse checks your syntax automatically in real time and nothing needs to be configured.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Xdebug and Zend debugger are supported. The latter is very good.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>You can interface with a SVN repository by using a plugin named Subeclipse<\/strong> that you find in the menu item “Help -&gt; Eclipse Marketplace”.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">A couple of refactoring functions are offered via a menu item named Refactoring. Netbeans has more of them.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">When you type “\/**” and hit enter, the same miracle as with Netbeans occurs. You get a skeleton phpdoc comment with the parameters of your function. Just do it before a function’s definition.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">PHPUnit is supported and needs some configuration as it happens in Netbeans. This is expected as PHPUnit is an external product.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Zend Framework is based on Eclipse and you can install software that enables Eclipse to create Zend projects.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">With some dirty tricks you can have at least autocompletion for the most common functions of any framework.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Aptana Studio 3<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/www.aptana.org\/">Aptana Studio<\/a> is for <strong>Ajax applications<\/strong>. It’s a son of Eclipse and it’s fully customised to help build Ajax applications.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">So, you find <strong>great support for Javascript<\/strong>. There is even an integrated debugger for Javascript.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Aptana isn’t only Javascript. It supports also HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, Rails, PHP and Python.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">There is no refactoring, PHPUnit and PHPDoc are supported. You can debug php code using the usual Xdebug if you install and configure it.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">PHPStorm<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/www.jetbrains.com\/phpstorm\/">PHPStorm<\/a> is a commercial product.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Debugging for Javascript and PHP are integrated. No need to install anything.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Versioning is well-supported. Many Version Control Systems are supported including Subversion, Mercurial, Git, Perforce, CVS, and TFS.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Syntax checking is quite advanced and there are no problems with PHPUnit and PHPDoc.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Even frameworks are supported out-of-the-box. There is integrated support for Symfony2, Yii and Zend.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Refactoring functions are way more sophisticated than the ones featured by Netbeans or Eclipse<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Be sure to run PHPStorm on a very powerful computer.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Komodo IDE<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https:\/\/www.activestate.com\/komodo-ide">Komodo IDE<\/a> is another commercial product. I have reviewed Komodo Edit, the free editor that is a simplified version of Komodo IDE.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Komodo IDE shines for its debugging capabilities<\/strong>. You can even see inside what is transmitted between client and server via the http protocol! If there is no encryption you can see passwords travelling from your PC to the server!<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It supports not only the php language, but also javascript, css and html that are all needed to build web applications.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Incredibly, <strong>refactoring functions are missing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Zend Studio<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/www.zend.com\/products\/studio\/">Zend Studio<\/a> is as elephant-like as Zend and both are commercial products.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Zend Studio offers integrated, out-of-the-box debugging facilities for PHP and Javascript.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Syntax highlighting and code auto completion are good at least for PHP and Javascript. They could be improved for html and css. There is real-time syntax checking.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Obviously Zend Studio integrates very well with Zend<\/strong>. I would definitely use Zend Studio for a Zend project.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Refactoring is quite good and support for PHPdoc and PHPUnit is provided.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">You can use your favourite Versioning System because Zend Studio will likely support it without needing plugins.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Code Lobster<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>UPDATE<\/strong>: Just an additional review about CodeLobster<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/www.codelobster.com\/">CodeLobster<\/a> PHP Edition is a free portable IDE primarily intended for creating and editing PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript files. It supports Drupal CMS, Joomla CMS, Smarty template engine, Twig, JQuery library, CodeIgniter framework, CakePHP framework, Symfony framework, Laravel framework, Phalcon framework, Yii framework and WordPress blogging platform. It includes PHP debugger, dynamic help, advanced autocomplete for all languages and frameworks and HTML\/CSS inspector like FireBug has.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">PHP IDEs need time to learn. They are more complex than PHP editors and offer more sophisticated functions.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">For small projects <strong>Geany<\/strong> is good. It’s light and has a neat interface.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Netbeans<\/strong> is better when projects get bigger and more complex. It has many functions ready to use without annoying hassle.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">I would use <strong>Eclipse helios for php developers<\/strong> if I needed a plugin to solve a particular problem. Eclipse has more than 1,000 plugins. I guess that I’ll find something to suit my needs.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>Aptana Studio<\/strong> is good if you develop Ajax applications even if you have to renounce some functions.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>PHPStorm<\/strong> is an interesting product.

Php developers are artists creating php software and php frameworks are some of their tools.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Does a php developer need php frameworks in the same way as a painter needs pigments?<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Not exactly. You can create software without frameworks. If you create clean and well-designed software, you can do without frameworks.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">While there is no need to explain why a painter needs pigments, there is a need to explain why developers use frameworks.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">The process of the artistic creation of software<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">A team of php developers is like an <a href="http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artist_collective">artist collective<\/a>. A group of artists working together to create an artwork.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Artistic creations have some characteristics that are common to every form of art.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Durability<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>We want to enjoy an artistic creation as long as possible<\/strong>. Even if it isn’t a masterpiece, it’s always a proof of human creativity.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>This is why we need documentation<\/strong>. Even for the restoration of a painting documentation would be great. Imagine if Van Gogh had left detailed documentation about his painting techniques, the pigments he used and the materials.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It would be much easier to restore his paintings so that future generations can enjoy them. Unfortunately, that documentation has to be recreated by the hard work of investigation.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Software is artwork that isn’t static. It’s a collection of instructions by which a computer transforms information to serve a purpose.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Its durability is more difficult to protect.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Software isn’t prone to wear and tear like a painting, but it has to be easy to change and maintain because changes in hardware or other software can easily make it stop working or become no longer useful.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It can also happen that software has to change if it is to continue to serve its purpose.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Certainly software that no longer works or that works but is no longer useful should stay in museums like any other human artwork.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">But software is made to work and we enjoy it more if it works and is useful.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">This is why documentation is so important when creating software.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>There is no durability for software without documentation.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Collaboration<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Many artworks need the collaboration of many artists to be created.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Php software is no exception. Large php applications are created by teams of developers. <strong>There is a need for organization and collaboration if a large php application has to be built successfully.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Structure<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Can’t we write just a single long php script? Yes, we can. But how will many developers collaborate? Will they edit the script at the same time? It won’t work. We need to divide the software into many files and have each file assigned to a different developer. Two developers can’t work on the same file.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Structure also means that we need to know precisely what each file is for. This helps developers with their creative efforts. <strong>Every part of the software can be created successfully if the role of each of them is well-defined.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It’s like an orchestra. Every musician has to know what the other musicians are going to play in order for the orchestra to give life to a symphony.<\/p>\n\n<h3 dir="ltr">Tricks of the trade<\/h3>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Every art has its tricks of the trade. It’s true that creativity longs for novelty, but why reinvent the wheel? Before experimenting with new sounds when creating music it may be a good idea to have a look at existing ones.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">In the same way, before creating new software to perform a task it’s good to see if this has already been done.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><strong>To use existing code to perform a task reduces errors and helps other developers<\/strong> deal with your code if they are familiar with the code you used for that task.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">How php frameworks help with the process of the artistic creation of software<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Php frameworks help developers to:<\/p>\n\n<ul><li>improve the durability of their artworks (programs)<\/li>\n\t<li>collaborate with other developers<\/li>\n\t<li>give a structure to their code so that they “know what the other musicians are playing”<\/li>\n\t<li>take advantage of the “tricks of the trade” that other developers created<\/li>\n<\/ul><p dir="ltr">Let’s have a look to a few of them.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr"\u003ECodeIgniter<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/ellislab.com\/codeigniter">CodeIgniter<\/a> is light and fast. It’s easy to configure and learn. It has a rich set of ready-to-use functions that save you time.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It’s flexible. You aren’t forced into strict rules. This may be seen as a minus point, but CodeIgniter is mainly used for small-medium applications so lack of structure is less of a problem.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It has a large community that helps.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">CodeIgniter is the base for a CMS (Content Management System) called ExpressionEngine. It’s software similar to the well-known WordPress.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">This is why it’s particularly suitable for creating CMSs.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">CakePHP<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/cakephp.org\/">CakePHP<\/a> will look familiar to developers who used Ruby on Rails. It’s a php framework simple enough for beginners but powerful as well.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It uses quite strict conventions that help to improve clarity and make development easier. On the other hand, these strict conventions may not suit your needs for flexibility.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">CakePHP is good for rapid prototyping and comes with a lot of features to help with implementing common tasks.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Laravel<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/laravel.com\/">Laravel<\/a> is the php framework for web artisans. I like this. I agree, software development is craftsmanship.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">What strikes one about Laravel is its elegance. I wouldn’t recommend this php framework to a beginner, but it’s perfect if you want to go to the next level. In particular Laravel is great if you come from CodeIgniter.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Laravel is more complex and powerful than CodeIgniter. It features code originating from more complex php frameworks and made easier.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">YiiFramework<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/www.yiiframework.com\/">YiiFramework<\/a> is a newcomer.

And I mean it literally since Zend’s logo is an elephant.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">You use <a href="http:\/\/framework.zend.com\/">Zend<\/a> only for huge applications that justify the complexity of Zend.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">To use Zend for a small-medium application is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Just have a look at their website and you will find a rich gallery of big names.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Anticipate devoting a long time to learning it.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Zend has been created by the creators of PHP itself, so it can be a good place to learn PHP.<\/p>\n\n<h2 dir="ltr">Symfony<\/h2>\n\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="http:\/\/symfony.com\/">Symfony<\/a> is an old php framework and it’s one of the big guys together with Zend.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">Like Zend, Symfony is used for big applications that have to fit enterprise requirements.<\/p>\n\n<p dir="ltr">It’s not for beginners, but it has a large community so help is readily available.

When I send a mailing to many contacts, CiviCRM sets the “Return-Path” header in the email to be something like: return+b.19.5.9c232c48e0ba219a@emanuelesantanche.com.<\/p>\n\n<p>When an email is returned because of errors, it should be sent to return@emanuelesantanche.com.<\/p>\n\n<p>The additional part b.19.5.9c232c48e0ba219a in the email address will tell CiviCRM which mailing and contact the original email was about.<\/p>\n\n<p>By using this information, CiviCRM will put the contact on hold, sometimes immediately, sometimes after a few failures occurred.<\/p>\n\n<h2><span>SMTP server not returning bounces correctly<\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p>It happens that the SMTP server I’m using, and many others, don’t process bounces properly.<\/p>\n\n<p>They should send the failure message to return+b.19.5.9c232c48e0ba219a@emanuelesantanche.com and the email should show up in the return@emanuelesantanche.com mailbox.<\/p>\n\n<p>CiviCRM should have nothing else to do than check the recipient, return+b.19.5.9c232c48e0ba219a@emanuelesantanche.com, and do its processing.<\/p>\n\n<p>Instead, the SMTP server sends the email back to where it was from, emanuele@emanuelesantanche.com.<\/p>\n\n<p>If CiviCRM checks the recipient, it doesn’t find the information it needs to process the bounce.<\/p>\n\n<h2><span>Scanning the entire email’s body<\/span><\/h2>\n\n<p>The solution is to scan the entire body of the returned email because somewhere there will be written that address CiviCRM needs.<\/p>\n\n<p>CiviCRM uses a regular expression like:<\/p>\n\n<p> \n<\/p><ol><li>\n\t<p><span>'
